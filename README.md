# lets-vote
a dapp for voting where all of the votes and candidate registration happens on chain.

# caution
This dApp is being built by someone who has a tenuous grasp on Solidity security at best.  The author is using this as a method of self-teaching, and is not 
responsible for any lost Eth or unattended side effects!  That being said, feel free to use anything you find useful, althought it probably is not novel and will be implemented better in other projects.
